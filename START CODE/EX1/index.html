    <h1>Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Returns in 2024!</h1>
    <p>After a six-year hiatus, the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show is back, and the lingerie brand’s future is being shaped by women.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/A8n9wf0R1xo?si=mj0YKpK52NZvlC-J">VSFS2024</a> was expected to livestreamed straight from New York City on October 15th 2024 
    earning much anticipation for the return of this iconic runway show. <br> Especially, along with the excitement of the return of the "og" angels-- a term they called the supermodels
    who has walked the runway of Victoria's Secret Fashion show.</p>
    <p>The presence of the female gaze was felt throughout the evening with a production that featured an all-women musical lineup, and a diverse cast of models wearing more<br> sophisticated — and in some cases, more comfortable-looking lingerie, including leggings and sheer coverups.</p>
    <p>The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is annual fashion show sponsored by Victoria's Secret, an American brand of lingerie and sleepwear. Victoria's Secret uses the show <br> to promote and market its goods in high-profile settings. The show featured some of the world's leading fashion models, such as Alessandra Ambrosio, Adriana Lima, <br> Barbara Palvin, Behati Prinsloo, Candice Swanepoel, Doutzen Kroes, Grace Elizabeth, Jasmine Tookes, Josephine Skriver, Kate Moss, Liu Wen, Taylor Hill, Tyra Banks, and others.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Will Victoria’s Secret soar to the heights it enjoyed a decade ago? The monoculture, which the retailer so deftly navigated back then, does not exist anymore, says Sherman of social media <br> changing consumer habits.

        “We all live on our tiny corner of the internet, so they’re (Victoria’s Secret) going to have to find their tiny corners, and the people who live there, to love them.”<br>
        
        This means that success today is very different from 2004 or 1994, she said there’s a desire to see Victoria’s Secret “achieve relevance again — and that is also harder than ever to do.”</p>
